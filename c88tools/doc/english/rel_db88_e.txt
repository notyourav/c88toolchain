  Ver 1.47    First release.
  Ver 1.48    Speeded up the Mix mode.

              having carried out command "GO" of DB88.
  Ver 1.52    Corrected that an error was given when it turned on Output Warning
              Message of DIALOG which appeared in [Option] -[Settings].
  Ver 1.53    Corrected the bug that hung up with PRC88408 or the tool bar became
              disabled, after having carried out command "GO" of DB88 and took a
              forced break.
  Ver 1.54    Corrected the bug that a step carried out a program at the time of
              Bus mode: expansion and MCU: maximum mode setting, the CB,NB,EP,XP,YP
              register of the register window was not displayed. (with Windows XP)
  Ver 1.55    Corrected the bug that did not break even if there was a break point
              when a hardware break was set and step was carried out.

                 line corresponding to the address with a source window.
              2. Corrected the bug that when there is a large quantity of disassembler
                 lines in a source line at Mixture mode, indication becomes slow.
              3. Corrected the bug that an abs file including the debugging information
                 of a C source with many nests cannot be loaded.


2. Differences from the Manual
------------------------------

  None


3. Limitations and Known Problems
---------------------------------

(1) The command history function cannot be used with Windows2000/XP.

(2) There is a case to display unjust instruction when you scroll the [Source]
    window reversely, with selecting mixture display or reverse assembling
    display in the display form of the [Source] window, because the order of
    reverse assembling is different from the order of practice of S1C88CPU.

(3) System reset on the PRC board
    As for the PRC board built-in by ICE88UR, if the input level of the system
    reset terminal is a reset level, or the reset function of the SVD(Supply
    Voltage Detector) circuit is in condition to work, this ICE88UR debugger
    does not start. Be sure the system reset condition is released and restart
    the debugger.
